# Advent of LookML (and SQL) ((and table calcs))

I'm following along with the [Advent Of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) in Looker!

I'll try and keep the production version of this project updated with each day's activity and data by 11am Pacific, but I might not always make it fast enough— Feel free to go your own way or just wait impatiently. Before pinging me, make sure you've pulled from production!

The data for this lives in a public BigQuery sandbox (Standard SQL), and each day's data (once I've uploaded it) will be available at `lookerdata.adventofcode20.<daynumber>`. Sometimes I'll make tweaks to the data to make your life easier (see day 4, for example)

## How to participate

The adventofcode project contains a model `advent` and view files for each day. Note that the view file names are numeric but the actual view name is the string (ie: `1.view` contains `view: one{}``). Just keeps the ordering pretty.

The production version of this project will never have answers, and only ever have the base for each activity.

To work on an activity, *enter your dev mode* and complete the activity in your dev mode.

There's no real rules, but I'm trying to be as Looker-y as possible— I'm sure SQL use will be extremely heavy on more complex challenges, but where possible I want to rely on built-in LookML, Looker UI capabilities, and table calculations. You can go your own way :)

Once you've got a solution for a day's activity, head to [https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/<daynumber>](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) and input your solution. That'll unlock Part 2 of the activity, which you can come back and complete!

I recommend saving a Look of each completed solution to your personal folder, in the format Day x Part x. It won't work for others who don't have the same LookML as you, but it's nice to refer back to.

**I really, really want to see how you think through these. PLEASE please share your work!**

**Post your solutions in the [Advent of LookML group](https://community.looker.com/groups/advent-of-lookml-1015) in the Looker Community. And/or tweet your work #adventofcode #adventoflookml.**
