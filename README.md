# Advent of LookML (and SQL) ((and table calcs))

I'm following along with the [Advent Of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) in Looker!

I'll try and keep the production version of this project updated with each day's activity and data, but I might not always make it fast enough— Feel free to go your own way

The data for this lives in a public BigQuery sandbox (Standard SQL), and each day's data (once I've uploaded it) will be available at `lookerdata.adventofcode20.<daynumber>`

## How to participate

The adventofcode project contains a model `advent` and view files for each day. Note that the view file names are numeric but the actual view name is the string (ie: 1.view has view: one{}). Just keeps the ordering pretty.

The production version of this project will never have answers, and only ever have the base for each activity.

To work on an activity, *enter your dev mode* and complete the activity in your dev mode.

There's no real rules, but I'm trying to be as Looker-y as possible— I'm sure SQL use will be extremely heavy on more complex challenges, but where possible I want to rely on built-in LookML, Looker UI capabilities, and table calculations. You can go your own way :)

I recommend saving a Look of your completed solution to your personal folder, in the format Day x Part x. It won't work for others who don't have the same LookML as you, but it's nice to refer back to.
