# --- Day 7: Handy Haversacks ---
# You land at the regional airport in time for your next flight. In fact, it looks like you'll even have time to grab some food: all flights are currently delayed due to issues in luggage processing.

# Due to recent aviation regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and their contents; bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities of other color-coded bags. Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!

# For example, consider the following rules:

# light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.
# dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.
# bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.
# muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
# shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
# dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
# vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
# faded blue bags contain no other bags.
# dotted black bags contain no other bags.
# These rules specify the required contents for 9 bag types. In this example, every faded blue bag is empty, every vibrant plum bag contains 11 bags (5 faded blue and 6 dotted black), and so on.

# You have a shiny gold bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag? (In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least one shiny gold bag?)

# In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:

# A bright white bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly.
# A muted yellow bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly, plus some other bags.
# A dark orange bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.
# A light red bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.
# So, in this example, the number of bag colors that can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag is 4.

# How many bag colors can eventually contain at least one shiny gold bag? (The list of rules is quite long; make sure you get all of it.)

  #This one's pretty easy to use https://csv-sql.web.app/ for, since it's just one column,
  # but that column has COMMAS in it! Disaster. Easy fixâ€” Just copy and paste into a g sheet,
  # then download as csv to wrap each line in quotes. upload that csv to csv-sql and you're good to go.
